# Finding lane line on road
Main process is described in [homework.ipynb](https://github.com/kuniyasu/udacity_homework1/blob/master/homework.ipynb).

## Lane Line Decetion Pipeline Image Processing
### Step 1. Invalid Region Masking
A triangle area ,that is closed by bottoms vertex and center on screen, is fixed.

> note: If you not sufficient that Center on screen and more adaptive controll is necessary, Optical-flow or sume solution is better. 

### Step 2. Color Select
White and orange colors are supported. Please adjust variable __white_th__ and __orange_th__.

> note1 : Binalized data is not shape sometime. I think that dilate and erode filters are effective.

> note2 : RGB color selection is depended luminance, I suggest that RBG shold be convert to HSV color.

### Step 3. Edge Feature Extraction Canny Filter
Edge data is generated by Binalized data.
__low_threshold__ and __high_threshold__ is adjust variable.
    
### Step 4. hough 
- rho = 2 : 
Distance resolution in pixels of the Hough grid

- theta = nm.pi/180 :
Angular resolution in radians of the Hough grid

- threshold = 15 :     
Minimum number of votes (intersections in Hough grid cell)

- min_line_length = 40 :  
Minimum number of pixels making up a line

- max_line_gap = 20 : 
Maximum gap in pixels between connectable line segments
